			<p class="fact-style"> The Giraffe is a long-necked, hoofed mammal that is natively found grazing in the open woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span>Scientific Name</span>: Giraffa camelopardalis</li>
				<li><span>Average Length</span>: 13ft - 20ft</li>
				<li><span>Average Lifespan</span>: 20 - 25 years</li>

			</ul>
			<p> The Giraffe is the tallest living animal on land and despite its height is mostly closely related to the much smaller and solitary Okapi, that is found elusively dwelling in the dense tropical forests. There are nine recognised sub-species of Giraffe that are found in differing geographic locations and vary somewhat in the color and pattern of their spot-like markings.</p>
